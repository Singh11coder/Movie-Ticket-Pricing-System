# Movie-Ticket-Pricing-System
The Movie Ticket Pricing System is a console-based application developed in C++ that allows users to simulate a basic ticket booking system for a movie theater. The system provides an easy and interactive way to manage movie listings, schedule showtimes, handle ticket bookings, and calculate pricing based on different criteria
Key Features: Movie Listings,Showtime Management,Seat Selection,Dynamic Pricing,Billing System,Receipt Generation.
Technologies and Concepts Used:
C++ Programming: The project makes extensive use of C++ features like classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and file handling.
Data Structures: Arrays and vectors are used to store movie data and available seats.
Object-Oriented Design: Different components (movies, tickets, showtimes) are represented using objects and classes.
File I/O: Movie data, pricing, and booking history can be stored and retrieved using file input/output operations.
Algorithms: Basic algorithms for seat availability checking and dynamic pricing adjustment based on seat selection and timing.
This project can be used as a fundamental building block for more complex movie ticketing systems. It can be integrated with GUI libraries or even expanded into a web-based application. It serves as an excellent demonstration of object-oriented programming in C++ and practical application of programming concepts in real-world scenarios.
